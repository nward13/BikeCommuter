# BikeCommuter
Basic App that uses text to speech to read the current time to the user. Allows user to set a time interval and the number of text-to-speech notifications, then reads the time to them at the designated intervals. This is just a project I put together to get more comfortable with Java and the Android Development workflow. The "BikeCommuter" name is actually a nod to some future additions with time to destination and other features to make the app ideal for people bike commuting and unable to check if they might be running late. The app is currently published on the Google Play Store under the name "Talking Clock". Thanks for checking it out!
